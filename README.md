# FollowFitCode

This project consists of an Android fitness application that helps users with logging and tracking their fitness progress, by allowing them to enter their workout data into a database that they can view or edit afterwards. The app can store workout information for each day on a calendar and take weight measurement inputs from the user and represent the accumulated inputs over time on a graph to show progress.
